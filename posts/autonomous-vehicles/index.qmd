Blog about Autonomous Vehicles and Deep Learning

Nowadays, there are always discussions talking about Autonomous Vehicles and the safety of these vehicles on our public roads. There are a great number of people that believe that autonomous vehicles are not safe and prefer to drive on their own. This belief is reasonable though as we are still in the early stages of autonomous (AV) vehicle technology, however future implementations of autonomous vehicle technologies have great potential in making our roads safer with machine learning and deep learning becoming more talked about topic within research and development regarding AV technology. A survey about autonomous vehicle technology shows that there is a belief from experts that deep learning methods such as end-to-end learning in autonomous vehicles is the future to further improve upon in autonomous vehicle technology (Kelkar et al., 2026). This technology would be crucial for reducing the amount of vehicle related injuries and death as according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 94% of crashes are due to driver related errors (Singh, 2015).

# What are autonomous vehicles?

Autonomous vehicles are vehicles that use built in cameras, radar systems, and LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) to sense their environment such as detecting pedestrians, road lanes, other vehicles etc. These vehicles operate automatically with minimal or zero human input using written algorithms or more recently machine learning techniques such as deep learning.

# What is deep learning and how does it tie into AV technology?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks which have many layers like a brain which are used to learn complex patterns in data. It uses very large datasets of prelabelled data to learn the different patterns by associating different characteristics of the data being learned. This can be used to learn patterns on the road such as road hazards or different types of lanes. Deep learning essentially helps autonomous vehicles to make human-like decisions when on the road such as changing lanes, predicting movements from surrounding vehicles, and classifying road signs such as speed limits. Companies such as Tesla and Waymo have adopted the use of deep learning in their autonomous vehicle technologies.

# What are neural networks

Before jumping into the real world applications of Deep Learning, we should learn more about what neural networks are as they are an important topic when it comes to Deep Learning. As mentioned previously, neural networks are a type of machine learning model typically used in Deep Learning. When used in Deep Learning, neural networks are called Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Neural networks consist of neurons that are layered together to process data for pattern recognition. It can be used in applications such as image processing or natural language processing (NLP).

A neural network consists of:

- Input Layer - where the raw data such as image data is given

- Hidden Layers - where the learning occurs. It consists of weights, biases, and an activation function which allows for computations on the raw data

- Output Layer - where the results from the hidden layers are outputted.

# Real world application: End-to-End Learning

Now diving deeper into deep learning, there is a method of deep learning called end-to-end learning. In end-to-end learning, we give a deep learning model a large amount of raw data and let it learn any patterns in the data without needing to perform any preprocessing or feature engineering on the data and then getting a final output. The advantage of this method is that it is very simple as you only need one deep learning model to learn patterns in data, however it can be very expensive because you need a lot of data for it to effectively learn patterns. Tesla is a big example of a company switching from a traditional autonomous driving system to using end-to-end learning in their Full-Self-Driving (FSD) technology. It takes raw road footage through the vehicle's cameras and then learns patterns from that footage. It then directly gives inputs to the vehicle without needing to write set rules for the system like how traditional autonomous vehicles operate. Adopting a deep learning method such as end-to-end learning will allow autonomous vehicles to operate more like humans allowing the technology to learn as new data is processed rather than having to manually program new rules.

# Current issues with AV technology

Although autonomous vehicle technology is a great way to potentially reduce the amount of road related incidents, there are still flaws. An article expresses some concern regarding autonomous vehicles and the lack of accident data. Findings from this article suggest that “accidents involving Advanced Driving Systems occur more frequently than Human-Driven Vehicle accidents under dawn/dusk or turning conditions, which is 5.25 and 1.98 times higher, respectively” (Adbel-Aty & Ding, 2024). This is something that still needs to be addressed to make people comfortable with the adoption of AV technology, however with new implementations such as end-to-end learning, autonomous vehicle technology is only going to get better since deep learning is a method that has the ability to improve as it receives more data. Autonomous vehicle implementations that use deep learning will be able to keep on learning more complex patterns as more miles are driven by autonomous vehicles since in deep learning, the more data the neural network receives, the more characteristics it would be able to learn

# Conclusion

Overall, deep learning is something we are going to hear more and more about as autonomous vehicles become more prominent in the car industry. Although autonomous vehicle technology is not perfect in the current day, there are bound to be new improvements as new methods and subsets of machine learning such as deep learning are being applied, the technology is only going to make our roads safer and makes getting from point A to point B more pleasant giving people more peace of mind when they are out on public roads.
